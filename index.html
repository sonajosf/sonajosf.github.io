    <center><h1 style="color:blue;">How to stay safe from COVID19</h1></center>
    <center><h4><p style="color:gray;">Even though COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, taking adequate precautions can help prevent you from being infected.</p></h4></center>
    <p>The virus spread through small droplets from the nose or mouth of the affected person, when the person sneezes or coughs. These droplets can travel more than 1 meter from the source and might land on objects and surfaces. Other people can catch the virus by touching the surface and then touching their eyes, mouth or nose. The virus can also be caught by inhaling these droplets if the distance between the affected person is less than one meter.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Washing your hands frequently</h5>
    <p>
Since transmission mainly occurs through your hands, you should wash them frequently and thoroughly. It is recommended to use soap and water when available, else use hand sanitizers with sufficient amount of alcohol to kill off the germs.</p>
<h5>Avoid Touching Your Eyes, Nose and Mouth</h5>
<p>The virus can come in contact with your skin at any time, particularly your hands. If the contaminated skin touched your eyes, nose or mouth the virus can be transferred into your body thereby infecting you.</p>
<h5>Maintain Distance</h5>
<p>Depending on the level of outbreak in your local community it is advised to keep a safe distance of at-least 1 meter (> 3 feet) from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. If you are in the vicinity when the person sneezes or coughs they can produce small droplets which you can inhale and become infected if the person is infected.</p>
<h5>Cover Your Mouth and Nose while Sneezing or Coughing</h5>
<p>If you are coughing or sneezing do so while covering your face with a bent elbow or a hand kerchief. This would help prevent the spread viruses such as Flu, Cold or COVID-19.</p>
<center><h4><p style="color:gray;">I am Infected</p></h4></center>
<center><p style="color:gray;">If you are sick with COVID-19 or suspect you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, follow the steps below to help prevent the disease from spreading to people in your home and community.</p></center>
<h5>Stay home except to get medical care</h5>
<p>People who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to isolate at home during their illness. You should restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care.</p>
<h5>Avoid public areas</h5>
<p>Do not go to work, school, or public areas.</p>
<h5>Avoid public transportation</h5>
<p> Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.</p>
<h5>Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home</h5>
<p>Stay away from others: As much as possible, you should stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available.</p>
<p>Limit contact with pets & animals: You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus.</p>
<h5>Call ahead before visiting your doctor</h5>
<p>If you have a medical appointment, call the healthcare provider and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.</p>
<h5>Wear a facemask if you are sick</h5>
<p>If you are sick: You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) or pets and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office.</p>
<p>If you are caring for others: If the person who is sick is not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then people who live with the person who is sick should not stay in the same room with them, or they should wear a facemask if they enter a room with the person who is sick.</p>
<h5>Cover your coughs and sneezes</h5>
<p>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</p>
<h5>Dispose</h5>
<p>Throw used tissues in a lined trash can.</p>
<h5>Clean your hands often</h5>
<p>Wash hands: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.</p>
<p>Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.</p>
<p>Soap and water: Soap and water are the best option if hands are visibly dirty.</p>
<h5>Avoid touching</h5>
<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</p>
<h5>Avoid sharing personal household items</h5>
<p>Do not share: You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home.</p>
<p>Wash thoroughly after use: After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
<h5>Clean all “high-touch” surfaces everyday</h5>
<p>Clean and disinfect: Practice routine cleaning of high touch surfaces. **High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.</p>
<p>Disinfect areas with bodily fluids: Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.</p>
<p>Household cleaners: Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.</p>
<h5>Monitor your symptoms</h5>
<p>Seek medical attention: Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening (e.g., difficulty breathing).</p>
<p>Call your doctor: Before seeking care, call your healthcare provider and tell them that you have, or are being evaluated for, COVID-19.</p>
<p>Wear a facemask when sick: Put on a facemask before you enter the facility. These steps will help the healthcare provider’s office to keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting infected or exposed.</p>
<p>Alert health department: Ask your healthcare provider to call the local or state health department. Persons who are placed under active monitoring or facilitated self-monitoring should follow instructions provided by their local health department or occupational health professionals, as appropriate.</p>
